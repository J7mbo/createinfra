Create Infra
--

Deploying from scratch a Go application with TLS to a domain you have purchased.
Progression is through using terraform, ansible, letsencrypt, docker swarm, traefik, a VPN, openLDAP, Kibana, your own two-factor authentication and more!

Created more for me for future projects that I have built to deploy efficiently. Maybe you will find it useful.

You can follow this step-by-step by switching branches as each one builds upon the previous one.
